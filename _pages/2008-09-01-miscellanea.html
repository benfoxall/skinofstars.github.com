Other interests of mine, <em>this page is and will probably always be under construction</em>.
<h3>Essays</h3>
I'm considering putting my dissertation here, but it pushes close to 18,000 words all told so I'm sure we all have more to do with our time than read that... We'll see, for now here are a couple of essays.

<a href="http://skinofstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/FireflyAndNationalIdentity.pdf">Firefly and National Identity (PDF)</a>. I don't consider this one of my best works, but it was apparently of first class standard, all be it only just (71%). I find a read through of old works always shows up more of what you should have done, and this is something I would rewrite, but what the hell, here it is.

<a href="http://skinofstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/LifeInADay.pdf">Life In A Day (PDF)</a>. An honest and candid essay of self reflection and one of my final works at university. This is a look at a day in my life covering such topics as Foucault's panopticon in a digital world, gender relationships, masks in social environments and self cultivation. What a riot!
<h3>Designs/posters</h3>
<a href="http://skinofstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/misc-cover-and-spread.pdf">MISC Mag (PDF)</a>. I had no poster/publication modules on my course, so I decided to take one outside of my curriculum. You really should do these little extras if they catch your interest, as publishing does with me. This is a fictional magazine cover and double page spread done using Adobe InDesign. Now as anyone who knows me knows, I don't normally go for proprietary packages like this, but I'll say the text and layout manipulation was a delight to use.

I've got a load of posters that I did while running events at the Student Union. I'm a little embarrassed looking back at them now so you'll be lucky if I post them!

Hmm, here is Roland as a woman:

<h3>Music</h3>
You know what, you don't wanna hear my music. To be honest, I wouldn't even put you through my brief stint as a podcaster, if you ever used to hang around oonagi then I'm sure you'll remember them and that fact is enough. Go listen to some good stuff instead of whatever tosh I might produce. Here are some of my suggestions:
<ul>
	<li>Jeff Buckley</li>
	<li>PJ Harvey</li>
	<li>Queens Of The Stone Age</li>
	<li>Mogwai</li>
	<li>Tori Amos</li>
	<li>Lamb</li>
	<li>Tool</li>
	<li>Billy Bragg</li>
	<li>Boy Sets Fire</li>
	<li>The Go! Team</li>
	<li>Flaming Lips</li>
	<li>Godspeed You Black Emperor!</li>
	<li>The Knife</li>
	<li>Loituma (how can you not love <a href="http://www.leekspin.com/">this</a>?)</li>
	<li>At The Drive-in</li>
	<li>Mr Scruff</li>
	<li>Nick Cave</li>
	<li>Orbital</li>
	<li>Planningtorock</li>
	<li>Sigur Ros</li>
</ul>
That is all.
