<em>*Page still in construction*</em>

I'll admit it straight away, I'm an Open Source fanatic. I have been using various flavours of Linux for several years now and the only version of Windows I use is within a virtual machine and is used only to test designs in Internet Explorer or play with other potentially interesting software. Still, I understand enough about operating systems that I am the friends and family tech guru. Does that mean I know how to use Excel? No. Does it mean that I can recover all your data on what looks like a lost machine, recover your system and have your OS of choice running faster than it did when it came out of the box? More likely a yes.

<strong>Rigs</strong>
For some reason or other I decided to make a page dedicated to my <a href="/node/138">setups</a>.

<strong>Top Software Apps</strong>
Though I'm a Gnome user, I do love the KDE app <a href="http://amarok.kde.org/">Amarok</a> for managing my music collection. Though it is currently a Linux only bit of kit, it will be available for Windows users as part of the port of KDE to the Windows platform
<a href="http://www.gimp.org/">The Gimp</a> is a fantastic image creation and manipulation tool. I find it indispensable in creating websites. Also available for Windows with the GTK toolkit
Though I have tried many GUI ftp clients, I always come back to <a href="http://filezilla-project.org/">Filezilla</a>, especially now it has been ported to the unix platform.
One of the unsung heroes from the Mozilla foundation, <a href="http://www.mozilla-europe.org/en/products/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a> is just fantastic. It is also extendable (like Firefox), so you can make it do as you choose.

<strong>And...</strong>
Yes, this is in construction. I plan on discussing methods of encrypting your own traffic. Ways to get the most out of old boxes ... and anything else I can think of that interests me :)
