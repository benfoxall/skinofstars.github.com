What am I driving at with a revamp of a blog that I once killed? Well... I always wanted an area of the net I can call my own. I'd registered skinofstars.com some time ago but I'd never really got round to sorting it out. In the end I just annoyed myself, this is my bit so I really should have a little 'me time'. So here we have it, a revamped skinofstars.com. As I'm sure you can tell, the blog is now the front page and I intend to update regularly. When I say regularly, I mean <strong>every Monday by noon</strong>. What I'll be saying I'm not sure, but I think some consistency is very important right now so I'm going to stick with that regardless. If you want to follow without the need for a visit then subscribe to this page's RSS using <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">http://www.skinofstars.com/rss.xml</span> http://skinofstars.com/feed

See you next Monday
