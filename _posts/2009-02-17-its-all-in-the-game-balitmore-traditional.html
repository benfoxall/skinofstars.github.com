Like many of you I'm sure, I've watched my fair share of TV. For the last two and a half years though I've not had one. My occasional glimpses of whats on the box are during visits to friends and family. Still, I don't feel this is a loss at all,  when I want something to watch I simply use the all mighty Interwebulator. Not only does the BBC provide a fantastic service, there are many other places to get quality content. The fact of the matter is that I feel it has made me all the more selective about what I do watch. Yet another generic home improvement or reality TV show just doesn't make the grade. Despite this I've still found myself watching some absolute trash, recent seasons of Heroes and Lost come to mind. But today I'm not wanting to talk about what is rubbish, I think you can decide that for yourself, I want to tell you about one of the best shows I have seen in many many years; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire_(TV_series)">The Wire</a>

The Wire is at it's most simplistic level a cops and criminals affair. Set in Baltimore, each season follows an ever expanding ensemble cast through different themes; drugs, the docks, politics, education and the media. The most striking aspect though is that a balanced amount of time is spent on each side of the different groups and equal measures of justice and injustice are received by both. Watching it you find yourself rolling through empathy, admiration and revulsion at both the prominent as well as the more obscure characters. You also find subtle points of interest are dropped in which later allow for little in-jokes for the more observant viewers. The Wire is a rich tapestry which doesn't beg for your attention with tacky ploys like explosions or excessive violence. To the contrary, it is often quiet, considered and will punish you if you were not paying enough attention before. There are no neat, self-contained episodes like CSI or NYPD Blue, you need to watch it as a whole. Don't let that put you off though, it pays back your efforts ten fold. If you only watch one TV show this year, watch The Wire.

Still not convinced? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ2iGYwdEi8">See what Charlie Brooker thinks of The Wire</a>

This has caused me a problem though. I was fussy with my TV before, now my standard is going to be unbearably high. I hope that the next show made by The Wire's creators, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Kill">Generation Kill</a>, will meet these expectations.
