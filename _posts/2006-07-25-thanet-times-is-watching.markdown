I'm upset. Someone smashed a cup on my car which caused a dent in the bonnet. Then I noticed that the most of the passenger side had been keyed. Why? I was parked sensibly outside the Regency in Ramsgate. I hadn't done anything wrong. There was no need. :(<br /><br />Also noted today that Gannet College blog got mentioned in the Thanet Times. Though looking at the screen shot they had as a pic I noted there was some serious issues with the way their computers display web pages. None the less though, the local papers must be spending time on the thanetbloglist to find it, so carefull what you say people. You are being watched.
