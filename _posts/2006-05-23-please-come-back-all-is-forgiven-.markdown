Eastcliff seems to have sunk into silence. His blog is now sub-titled 'Closed due to unexplained fire'.<br />The blog comments have been turned off. The word on the circuit is that he's thrown in the towel. This is a dispointing outcome to the furore over over the last week or so. Eastcliff has inspired many new bloggers, including me. His blog provided a central point for these new bloggers and frankly the much needed comical relief from all the dull bloggists, again including me. I wonder how well this new breed would do without that. Lets hope this is only a temporary haetus and we can get back on with the serious buisness of ridiculing Thanet.<br /><br /><br />On that note, I'll introduce a new blogger who is probably the youngest yet at 17.<br /><a href="http://margatedobson.blogspot.com">margatedobson.blogspot.com</a>
