This week has been damn crazy. I seem to be missing loads of messages by leaving the msnm on, so if I've missed you, I'm sorry. I'm having to follow two programmes doing the combined, so when I see the guys from the comp soc, I don't know as I'm mainly based in Harcourt. I'll have to just leave notes <a href="http://tardis.brookes.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">on the wiki</a> or something for now.<br /><br />So far as the Thanet crew goes, I guess its time I was removed from the Thanet Blog List. Hopefully whoever runs that will note this, as well as the guys who are commenting themselves in on the <a href="http://thanetbloglist.blogspot.com/2006/05/this-is-thanet-blog-list.html">primary listing post</a>.<br /><br />Get back soon I hope.<br />Kevin
