Thanet, Margate, Ramsgate, Broadstairs, Birchington, Westgate, Kent International Airport, Minster, Manston.<br /><br />I know, it's a cheap ploy, but I also know that people search by their town names. These are my local towns and I'm a big fan of local stuff in general. Certainly, much early cinema was spread by the publics desire to see their own home towns on film, and perhaps to some extent the same can be said about the internet. Let us hope is remains driven in that way and doesn't blend into a bland hollywoodnet.
