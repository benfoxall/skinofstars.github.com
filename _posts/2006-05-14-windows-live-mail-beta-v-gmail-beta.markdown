Battle of the betas I see. Hotmail has upgraded to Live Mail in a blatant attempt to challenge Gmail. Of course, like any old web hand I have a hotmail account and I'm happy to try this out. Is it as cool as gmail? Not on your nelly! They've tried to make it too much like outlook. It lacks gmails addictive simplicity and inventive ideas and the last thing I want are huge picture ads in my mail windows. Still, it's better than old hotmail, you can't deny that. Loading up a new page for each and every action was soooo annoying before.
