It's taken me some time and a little soul searching if ones being honest, but I have finally decided to leave blogger behind me. Blogspot has served me well enough but struggled with the resrictions I always feel when someone else is hosting my webbyness, so I felt it was time we parted ways. Now I get the freedom to improve or make a mess of my own site. Though I'm sure I'll lose a bit of traffic like this, I don't think it really matters much these days.

Thankfully, and to make life extra easy, it is stupidly simple to transfer all your posts and comments over.
