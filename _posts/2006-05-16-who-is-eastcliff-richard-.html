Been working and drinking at the pub today where I found myself in a conversation with none other than Eddie Gadd of <a href="http://www.ramsgatebrewery.co.uk/index.html">Gadds brewery</a>, Ramsgate. The hot topic of conversation... Who is <a href="http://eastcliffrichard.blogspot.com">Eastcliff Richard</a>? Apparently the local loo roll known as Thanet Times has been asking the very same question. I was and am certainly interested to know who he is, but not at the risk of his blog. Eastcliff brings up some very good points in some funny ways and I'd hate to see trash like the Thanet Times discover who he was and get one over on him. So I will suppress my curiosity and applaud his anonymity.
