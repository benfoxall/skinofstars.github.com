This Drupal install has been replaced with Wordpress

<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">I've just added some more sections to the site. </span>

<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><a href="/social">Social</a> - covers various social networking sites.
<a href="/net_work">Net Work</a> - this section is like a portfolio of my work on the internet (job please!).
<a href="/geekness">Geekness</a> - a section where I can while away time on my more general interests in computing, expect lots of open source zealotism.
<a href="/further">Further</a> - bit like a misc section, but I feel a little funny about filing the rest of my life under miscellaneous, so I called it Further</span>

<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">This was a framework that I came up with a month or two back and I think best sums up the point of having a site dedicated to myself (bar ego, of course). It should make it easy for me to add to the site with notes and information I have written for myself and others. I hope this is now to be the encompassing personal site I'd always wanted.</span>
