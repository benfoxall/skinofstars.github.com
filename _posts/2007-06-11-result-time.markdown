Here are my marks so far for my first year of Uni. Not too bad considering how drunk I was:<br /><br />Computer Systems - A<br />Multimedia IT Skills - A<br />Human Development and Learning - B+<br />Human Communication - B+<br />Communication in Groups - B+<br />Playing the Game: The Culture of Digital Games. - B<br />Structured Programming - C<br /><br />It would seem that I'm at my best and my worst when I'm with computers, go figure.
