Lying in bed with my thoughts I have stumbled across a problem. It looks like this:

revel - lever
team - meat
nib - bin
tip - pit
real - lear
made - edam
desserts - stressed

What are they?

Now, I know that they are palindromes when placed together, what I want to know is the name of a word that changes its meaning when reversed. If you know the answer then for the sake of my sanity please post it in a comment. Also, I'd be interested to see any others that you can come up with.
