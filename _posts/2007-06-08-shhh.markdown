Ok, I'll break my silence, if for nothing more than the fear that I may soon end on <a href="http://eastcliffrichard.blogspot.com/">ECR</a>s 'Where are they now?' list!<br /><br />I've not ignored Thanet in any way, I take the Thanet Times back to Oxford with me (or get them brought to me!) when I can and keep up with blogging through the wonder of the internet. You know, I found I can be anywhere to read these blogs, not just in Thanet, amazing things these Internets.<br /><br />I often find that when I see something interesting I think about how I would put it in a blog post, but it would seem I'm now into the habit of not posting. Lets take this example: The other day I was in Margate and was almost knocked over by Sandy Beach who was rounding a corner at high pace away from the town, only to find that when I got to Margate centre the whole town was without power... link perhaps?!<br /><br />The topic of the moment though does seem to be <a href="http://www.thanetbloglist.co.uk">TBL</a>s birthday. I can hardly believe it to be a year already. That curious, spiraling turning of events that began with <a href="http://skinofstars.blogspot.com/2006/05/scoop-nobody-wants.html">turmoil on the blogger circuit</a> to the rise of the blog list. Though for my sins I may have started it, to my better judgment I handed it to <a href="http://www.ademweb.co.uk/blog/">Adem</a> who has made it into a truly useful and enjoyable resource... though I must be honest, I cannot stand this Snap preview thing (cue tech tip). If you want to turn it off this is what you have to do: hover over a link to the snappy thing appears, got to options in that pop-up, check the boxes to disable, when it saves reload.<br /><br />Ok, I'm here for the next month so I'll probably post again, mainly because I see this as a Thanet blog. After that I'll probably pull it into my new personal site that I'm planning (see if you can guess the web address ;) ).<br /><br />For all you Thanet bloggers: Keep up the good work!
