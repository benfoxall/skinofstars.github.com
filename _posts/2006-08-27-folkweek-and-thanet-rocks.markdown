I don't seem to do this very often, maybe time for a bit of an update. <br /><br />Summer for me is pretty much over now, but it was a good one. I took just over a week off work for folk week (yes, the whole week and yes, I know the words to the clarence the dragon song) where I plied my way through many beers. It wasn't the best year, bit of a washout at first, but it was still very good. I even managed to get in some fireclub passing going on the beach on the wednesday. I normally do alot of cicus type stuff at folk week, but I didn't so much this year. Probably got my yearly fix doing a circus workshop for Manston village fete a couple of weeks before.<br /><br />Much of my folkweek was taken up with flyering for a gig I was holding on the Sunday in Westgate which was called the Thanet Rocks End Of Summer Bash. Thanet Rocks being the recent tagline for oonagi... probably drop that a bit now as its been hammered pretty hard. Anyway, the idea of the gig was to have a bit of a festival of local original music. We had seven local bands and artists doing their own thing and all the money we made went to charity. We raised around Â£375 for Thanet Mind, whoop! Thats the summary, if you want to know all the trials and tribulations that went into it, plus a rundown of the day then a full write-up on The Gig 06 link at the top of <a href="http://oonagi.co.uk">oonagi</a>. Right at the moment I'm working on a mini-site bonus feature of a DVD thats being made of the day. We'll be selling them in the hope of raising a bit more money for the aforementioned worthy charity. <br /><br />Other than that I'm preparing to go to uni in september. Oxford Brookes to study computers and culture for three years. This has raised a concern with my role in oonagi. I do so much work on the site that I'm a bit worried at having to let it go. I'll still help out but I'm not going to be local, which is one of the fundamentals of oonagi.<br /><br />Ok, see you again in.... who knows \m/(^_^)\m/
