Sorry to say guys, but I have the scoop that nobody wants but we kinda expected. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Eastcliff Richard has quit. </span>I've been in email contact with Eastcliff Richard and he's detailed a list of reasons why. Here it is in his own words:<br /><br />Kevin asks,<br />"<span style="font-style: italic;">Whats happening dear fellow? You have closed down your blog.</span>"<br /><br />Richards reply,<br />"<span style="font-style: italic;">Several reasons dear fellow:</span><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">1. I'm having a prolonged sulk. Er, no, that's not it.</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Let's start again.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">1. Things have got out of hand recently, and I'm not</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">happy with the turn of events. The blog was meant to</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">be satire and humour, not argy-bargy, and all I was</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">hoping to do was have a bit of fun, and maybe make one</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">or two serious points by sugaring the pill. If other</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">people found it amusing too, all well and good.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">I'm afraid I mishandled the Ram Skate business with</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">our precious Dr Moores. It's very hard to get 'tone of</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">voice' across in the written word. I was trying to</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">keep the debate on a banter level, clearly I failed,</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">and now everyone seems to have ended up with a bad</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">case of sense of humour failure.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">2. When I started ECR I was genuinely hoping that</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">other, more alternative blogs would spring up, and</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">that's happened, which is great. I think it's about</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">time for me to hand over the baton.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">3. There's been such a clamour of people wanting to</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">know who I am, or who think they know who I am, that</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">people are pointing the finger at anyone and everyone.</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">The kind of stupid but scathing nonsense I write is</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">generally best served up anonymously, there'd be</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">little point if someone actually did find out who I</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">am, so I'm getting out while the going's good!</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Besides, I wouldn't want to wake up one morning and</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">find my cliff top mansion burnt down, would I? There</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">are people like that around here, as I'm sure you</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">know.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">4. TDC is letting Thanet down badly, it could be so</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">much better (go get 'em, Tony!). Sorry, that's not a</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">reason, just a political point.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">So there it is, the party's over, but it was good, if</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">a little odd, while it lasted. Good luck with Skin of</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Stars, do keep me abreast of hair developments so that</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">I can recognise you if I ever wander over to</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">********** for a pint of the Gaddfather's finest.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Please feel free to publish this if you want</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">(hopefully a bit of a scoop for you). Remember, don't</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">let the b*st*rds grind you down! I did, and now my</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">legs are teeny tiny stumps.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Yours</span><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">ECR</span><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">P.S Sorry about all that Michael Caine stuff when you</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">had your flash mob. At least you took it in the spirit</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">it was meant!</span>"<br /><br />Well there you go fellow bloggers. That's the scoop nobody wanted but alas we have.<br />Let us keep on blogging, I know I certainly will.<br /><br />So long Eastcliff Richard. It's been fun.
