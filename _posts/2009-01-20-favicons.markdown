Sorry for being a little late with the post. I'll be quick as I'm still working on my aforementioned project.

I thought I'd talk a moment on favicons considering the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7839744.stm">talk on Google's recent change</a>.

First thing you need is a favicon.ico file. There are all sorts of programs that, some free some not, that can do this job for you. Instead I'd recommend using a web service, <a href="http://favicon.cc">favicon.cc</a>.

Once you've saved your favicon and uploaded it to some webspace (however you prefer) then you need to link that icon to your code. This is pretty simple, just include the following code in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of your HTML:

<code>&lt;link rel="icon" href="http://example.com/favicon.ico" /&gt;</code>

Job done.
