Cripes, the <a href="http://scrine.org">Scrine Foundation</a> (a local homelessness charity) seem to have got themselves in a bit of controversy over the flyer for an upcoming event at the Pharmacy Gallery, Margate. The charity is normally sooo careful with their associations, but they seem to have been caught out a bit here with upset at unnecessary depictions of Nazi subjected humiliations. This is a shame to been caught out like this as it's such a worthy charity that deserves all the help and support it can get.<br /><br />More details of event with the original post and discussion @ <a href="http://artsandelbows.blogspot.com/">Arts &amp; Elbows</a>
