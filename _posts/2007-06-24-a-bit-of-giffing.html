Hmm, wonder if you can use the word gif as an adjective... Anyway, I spent a bit of time today making a simple animation inspired by such things as <a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=6B26asyGKDo">Noah's photo everyday for 6 years</a>. Thought it would be nice to do a really simple version with photos I've taken of myself over the past 3 years. You can see the result in my avatar, but I'll reproduce it here in case I change it:<br /><br /><img src="http://skinofstars.com/offsite/manykevinsmall.gif" alt="giffage" /><br /><br />It's not great but it is pretty easy to do. First things first is to get some appropriate software to put this together. In my case I decided to use the <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> with the GAP extension (erm, I'm just gonna let you find that). I'm sure there are far more specifically tailored programs but I know how to use the GIMP so it saved me spending time having to get familiar with a new UI.<br /><br />Step two would be to <a href="http://www.gimp.org/tutorials/Simple_Animations/">get a tutorial</a>, which luckily for me I have already read and used before on other projects but will be useful for any of you out there who are thinking a little bit of animation might also be a little bit of fun.<br /><br />Obviously my attempt at animation isn't exactly going to get me a job with Disney just yet but it is an interesting little experiment. I'll also say that I had far better luck when I tried the same thing thing with some photos of my sister. Whereas I have a tendency to only take the odd photo of myself for avatars and the like and make do with the first one or two, my sister is more compelled to take many and then decide which one to use after. So lets string them together and see what we get:<br /><br /><img src="http://skinofstars.com/offsite/manysarahsmall.gif" alt="" /><br /><br />Looks pretty neat eh? Though it may be worth pointing out that she'll probably kill me for posting this.
