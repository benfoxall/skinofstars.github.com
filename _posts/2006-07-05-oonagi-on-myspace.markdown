myspace, myspace... oh god, myspace<br /><p>I've never been the biggest fan of myspace, as anyone who's had to listen to me would know. Still, it is THE biggest social networking site on the internet with over 85million 'users'. So in view of this I've finally given in and set up an oonagi myspace. If you want to visit it you can, the URL is <a href="http://myspace.com/thanetrocks">myspace.com/thanetrocks</a>. A friend of ours is doing a zine of the local scene called Thanet Rocks. As this is also the tagline for oonagi it only seemed sensible that we combined forces, so this myspace thing is a combo of the two. We're also planning on a load of story sharing between the site and the zine. Paper and online, how about that for coverage and appealing to all sorts. A thought, there really should be a Thanet Times/Gazunder website.</p><p><br /></p>
