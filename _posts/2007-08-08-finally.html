Its taken long enough but I am finally back on the net. I thought that with all this high-speed world we were living in the internet wouldn't have take the better part of a month to sort out. First its problems with how long since you've had your phone line, then its that the previous people living here were with another company (hold on, I'm sure I set up a new line!?), then you have to wait for engineers, then you have to wait longer because of floods! All very painful.<br /><br />A few weeks ago we had our interband football tournament in Dane Park. We've been doing it for the past seven years (here is a link to <a href="http://skinofstars.blogspot.com/2006/06/football.html">last years football post</a>). I managed to get to the final this year but alas we were beaten by younger, fitter, chavs. Ah well. Just like to say a public thanks to all the lads who helped me organise the event. I'd also like to say a public shame on all those who left litter at the end, not cool.<br /><br />I was intending to do a rebuke to Tony's comments on my last blog post, but the moment is somewhat lost. He is right, Linux isn't the most prevalent desktop system. It is worth noting though that it is by no means a backwater system, for example, Blogger runs on Linux. So its  interesting that he was using said system to say that no-one uses it.<br /><br />Well, its a nice day so I'll leave you all to it. :)
