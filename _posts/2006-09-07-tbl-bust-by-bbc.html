Seems I got somewhat busted in the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/kent/content/articles/2006/08/31/kent_blogging_feature.shtml">BBC Kent article on bloggers</a> as the man behind the <a href="http://thanetbloglist.blogspot.com">Thanet Blog List</a>. Many of the more savvy would have guessed anyway, but its really out now, so I guess its time to discuss it.<br /><br />I started the list in reaction to Cliff Richard saying he was quiting the scene after a spat with the doctor. I was concerned that there wouldn't be the central point for bloggers to rally around. I also had issues with the links being removed from peoples blogs due to personal issues. I felt the best way to resolve this was an independent list that would link anyone regardless, trusting the reader to decide what was hot and what was not.<br /><br />Now we come to the problem. Not only is it not very independent now that its clear its me, but I am leaving Thanet and so feel I will have less time to hunt down local blogs.<br /><br />We have a few possible solutions here:<br />a) Kevin continues as is and only adds blogs when he checks thanetbloglist@yahoo.co.uk once every few months.<br />b) Some other person contacts Kevin saying they will take good care of it and will remain impartial.<br />c) I tell you all the login and password for the blog and you can all add stuff when you find it. Kevin (or someone) hangs onto the email to reset any abuses with a password reset.<br /><br />I personally like the third option as I'm a community thinking kinda guy, but I can see its problems.<br /><br />This is up to you guys to call it as its really your list.
