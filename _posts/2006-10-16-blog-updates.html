Thought I might talk a little about the changes I have made to my blog. The new layout is pretty obvious, I went for the ultra minimalist theme as thats just what I like to see on webpages. The new tagline, In the City Of Spires, is a (misquoted, should be Dreaming Spires) description of Oxford by a poet called Matthew Arnold in a poem where he harks back to his days of studying in the city:<br /><blockquote>'That sweet city with her dreaming spires,<br />She needs not summer for beauty's heightening'</blockquote><br />I have had a little adjustment to the left hand column. For the time being there are all the usual Thanet blog links, but I suspect that I will also change those in time, no rush though. I have adjusted a section to what is now called buttons, seeing as all the cool kid blogs have them. I've included the obligitory '<a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">get firefox</a>' button, as really everyone should. The bird at the top is called the <a href="http://songbirdnest.com">songbird</a>. It is a music player based on the same engines as the firefox browser. Its still in developmental stages so not recommend as a replacemnt for your current player (yet) but is good fun to use and a great way to search for and listen to music on the net.<br /><br />There is also a particularily interesting button on there for anyone who wants to just read all their favourite webpages in a glance, thats <a href="http://netvibes.com">netvibes</a>. Netvibes is essentially a web rss reader, but it has many other cool tricks under its belt. I will be honest, its through netvibes that I now read everyones blogs and has been the case for some time. It informs me when there is a new post on any one of a number of blogs I have listed on it and gives me the ability to read the post without ever having to visit the blog. It saves lots of time and effort. If there is something I want to comment on then a handy link is provided to the post. Alas, I can't see Tony's pics on it, but I have always had trouble with his feed, so thats nothing new for me.<br /><br />Below the button section we have my del.icio.us tags. <a href="http://del.icio.us">Del.icio.us</a> is a service that I use to bookmark webpages that I find interesting or useful. It is also possible for others to view those bookmarks I make. Tags are simply the categories that those links come under.
