Not only has <a href="http://artsandelbows.blogspot.com/">Arts and Elbows</a> not posted -in several months, but I've also noted that the <a href="http://www.galleryiota.org">IOTA website</a> has been taken over by cybersquaters, with the last record I can find (thanks to the <a href="http://www.archive.org/">waybackmachine</a>) is in April. Whats going on?<span id="formatbar_Buttons" style="display: block;"></span>
