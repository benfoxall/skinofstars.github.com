Thats right homies, it's come to an end. Tonight is the last quiz night at the Churchills, the coolest night in town where you'll find all the cats. This week all the rounds were picked by lasts weeks teams, so will include such topics as WWE, Harry Potter, Quantum Physics and my personal favourite Corronation Street.... actually, I don't know anything about any of them but I do like the real ales! It'll be a damn fun night and if your the worse one there, they give you chocolate! whoop!
