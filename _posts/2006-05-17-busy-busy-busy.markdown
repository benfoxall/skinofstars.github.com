Well, I've been using the google calendar and I now have a visual representation of how bloody busy my life is. I think I have a gap in there somewhere and within moments it gets filled. I think it was just nicer being busy and not noticing. I'm still not figured out quite how to let others view it without puting it on my own webspace or the other user being a google account holder. Sure I'll get that soon enough though.<br /><br />I'm off to go work the door for a tonights football at the student club. Thank God I don't have to watch it!
