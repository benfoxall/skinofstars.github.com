Today is the start of a new academic year at Oxford Brookes. As we would say here "Week 1". I get to start this new year with no lectures today, which frankly is quite lucky as I still have many things to sort out. Still, I decided to get up early, well, early for me, 9:30am. A habit I'm going to have to get into as I've been tending to sleep till noon through the summer. There always seems to be something I <em>need</em> to do at 2am.

Last week was freshers week (Week 0?!) so I tried to go out and party a little. Since moving into my new house and taking some time gardening I've found that I wasn't really going out, so I decided to make a bit of an effort. We were convinced that Saturday would be a big party at a student union club, Blitz. It had always been one of the best nights of the week, which left us convinced that it would be so this time with many old friends around. Guess we were the only ones who thought so. There were a few friends there, but to be honest it was only the ones we'd invited personally. Still, a fun night regardless.

Recovery from a Saturday night is easy when the sun is out. We are lucky in our new house in having a small gate from our back garden straight onto one of the largest parks in Oxford. South Park has one of the best views over the city so we had little to do than lay back, drink tea and soak in the view. An absolute treat considering the horrid weather we've been having of late.

And now to work.
