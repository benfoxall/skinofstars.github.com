I'm terrible at saving numbers in my phone, mainly because my phone is so awkward to use, but normally because I think 'I'll do it later'. Surely it would be better if each phone had its own ID  that the user sets which when you call someone it comes up as you ID/name. This avoids all those confused times of asking who it is when you don't recognise the number, or in some peoples cases, not answering at all.
That is all.
