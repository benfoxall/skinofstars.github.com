Hey All,

Just thought I would tell you all about a new site that I've created for homework. It's for an Oxford based band called Branch Immersion, a three piece acoustic outfit, some friends of mine. The site is hosted on the uni servers at the moment but I expect we'll host it here at SkinOfStars towers soon enough once they've bought their domain name and I've ported the static pages to Wordpress.

This is an original design and I must be honest, one I am very proud of. Please check it out at the temporary address (I'll update with the final address later):
