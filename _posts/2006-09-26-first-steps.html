Today has pretty much been my first lecture. I had one yesterday in human communication, but frankly that was a condesending insult, so I will just count this one. Today I learnt my first bit of the pascal coding language and wrote my first program. To be honest, i didn't really feel like I had learnt it as it was more copying than anything, but its a start.<br /><br />The main problem I have had though is getting a copy of delphi (the programming enviroment) for myself. I finally managed to pick one up on <a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?s=ef9acb6af62f66f9f98742b7cce6c4ed&t=110900">this thread</a> via polish site. Still setting it up at the moment, but all seems fine. I really wanted to have a version that worked in a linux enviroment, but it seems they stopped developing that some time ago, so I guess I will have to leave that and come back to the tux when I move on to C &amp; Unix in the next semester.<br /><br />I will say though, its great to be learning again, even if alot of it goes over my head :)
