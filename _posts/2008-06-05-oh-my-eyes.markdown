I write this through blurry vision having just had an injection into my eyeball. It seems I've been unlucky enough to be one of the few young people to have developed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration">Macular Degeneration</a> in my left eye. Seeing as I'm still reasonably young at 28 I decided to go for one of the fancy new unlicenced injections, my drug of choice in this instance is called Lutein. I'm happy to say that the eye hospital in Oxford is excellent and the doctor treating me is one of the best in the country. This still doesn't take away the sting of the possible impact on a career in web-app design (I can't see the screen so well these days), or the sting of the cost at Â£1500 an injection (no NHS for this treatment). Still, I hope to recover a bit of vision and perhaps in time I won't even notice it. I just hope the already visible signs of it developing in the other eye don't progress any further.
