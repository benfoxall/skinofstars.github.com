I was shocked to see a recent article by the Daily Mail which they claim finds that councils are <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1024162/Phone-spies-Town-halls-using-anti-terror-powers-bug-residents-calls-emails.html">abusing anti-terrorist powers</a> to check up on average citizens emails and phone calls. It's like 1984 all over. At the end of the summer I plan to move all my email correspondence to encrypted formats. I'll post between now and then with advice for all others who would like to keep a little bit of privacy in their lives before we are all routinely monitored.
