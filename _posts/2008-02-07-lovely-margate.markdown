Hey, just wanted to highlight an article in Kent Online that my friend Jay linked me to. Its about a  pair of local artists who are trying to bring a little love to <a href="http://www.kentonline.co.uk/news/default.asp?article_id=38217">Margate this Valentines Day</a>. The main reason I'm bringing this up is that I know the work of one of them, Selina Tolfree, and I very much like what she does. Because of that I'm urging you all to hunt out her work where you can (I'll try to update with links at some point) and have a look for yourselves.
