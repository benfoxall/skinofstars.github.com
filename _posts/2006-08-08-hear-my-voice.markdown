Admin authentication is starting to annoy me. I can understand in some cases with the blogs, but frankly, the admin can just delete the posts anyway, so why bother. What really annoys me is when it's supposed to be on a social site outside of blogger. Why should the admin tick off each post? Its not the dark ages of the internet anymore, so why do small site owners still not trust the users to say something sensible. Frankly, I find it very off putting and it discourages input. I am one of the 1% who creates content, but I'm not going to if you don't trust what I have to say.
