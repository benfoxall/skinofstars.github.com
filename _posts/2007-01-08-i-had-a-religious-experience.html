Whilst at work the other day I met many of the members of the <a href="http://www.globalgeneration.co.uk/">Global Generation Church</a>. They do alot of work in the area with the community, infact it is their primary goal as a church. This may be related to the fact that this is a very young organisation (over 30 and you stand out) and so they want to make an impact on the community and get more members, or perhaps they are just good people. They certainly shook my view as to what a church is like, these guys weren't middle England style baking competitions and tea with vicar. Hell, they don't even have a vicar to lead the flock, the task is taken on by a team of shepherds who are as much leading themselves as others.

So is this a good thing? Should it be down to a church to provide youth clubs as well as providing advice on drug use and sexual health? Is it because of the gaping hole in public services that these groups feel compelled to set up these services or is it because organisations like Global Generation set up these services that our elected bodies feel they now don't have to deal with these social issues?

Meeting these guys gave me a new found respect and hope for Christian organisations but in my mind it still raises some troubling questions about society.
