In a follow-up to <a href="http://skinofstars.blogspot.com/2007/06/bbc-in-bed-with-ms.html">my previous post</a> regarding the incompatibility of the  new BBC iPlayer I recently found an interview on <a href="http://backstage.bbc.co.uk/news/archives/2007/11/interview_with_1.html">backstage.bbc</a> in which the developers of the iPlayer and representatives from the Open Source Consotium and the Open Rights Group discuss this very topic. It would seem that the  general consensus is that release of the iPlayer to be bound to one operating system was in many ways a demonstration of the problems with DRM (Digital Rights Management) and thankfully just a stepping stone to more open access, initially through streaming and then hopefully to more open access.

Interestingly enough the developers pointed out that it is only a very small piece of the whole delivery system that was written in a proprietary format, namely the bit that goes on your computer. Over 90% of the system is running on Solaris  with many of the developers using Debian based systems.

Ok Tony, off you go....
