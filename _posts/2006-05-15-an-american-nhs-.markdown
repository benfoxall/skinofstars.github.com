Are those guys over the pond gonna actually catch up with our good old NHS? Especially at a time when we are looking at privitising it (well, if Dave Cameron gets in). Seems Massachusetts is <a href="http://www.playfuls.com/news_00751_Romney_Signs_Landmark_Massachusetts_Health_Insurance_Reform_Bill.html">heading down that road</a> with a compulsory, but cheap statewide healthcare system. Perhaps a starting point for wildfire that will spread across the country, or perhaps just a flash in the pan.
