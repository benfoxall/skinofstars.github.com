I'm doing an open post here in a vain hope that it may be spotted by the author of the blog by the title we see above. Though I know it unlikely to be spotted due to techy the nature of my blog, I'll try anyway. If you want to visit it, <a href="http://theanginamonologues.blogspot.com/">just click here</a>.<br /><br />The blog name is excellent, especially considering the demographic. He (I thought it to be a she at first, considering the title) was an Eastcliff Richard fan, but lost his way after the link was removed from the doctors site. I know I'm still linked, for now. Anyway, I wish the writer the best of luck and hope they keep writing. Unfortunately I can't tell them directly as they currently have the comments and all forms of contact turned off.
