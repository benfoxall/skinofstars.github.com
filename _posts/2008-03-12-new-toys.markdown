I'm very excited today after winning an auction last night on eBay. I'd decided that I needed a computer as doing graphic work and generally pouring through code is hard work on this little laptop. What I needed was a mighty box, which is what I've now just bought.

The specs on this beast are as follows; intel core2 quad with a combined speed of 9.6ghz, 2gb of ram (I will certainly upgrade that to 4gb), 500gb esata (quick access thingy) hard drive and an nvidia 8500gt graphics card which can do HiDef... which means I need a HiDef monitor, which I get that tomorrow, 22" widescreen.

Yes, these are very geeky boys toys but I am now very excited. My next question is what operating system I'm going to put on it.
