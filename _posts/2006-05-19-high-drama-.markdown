Oh the excitement of the internet! Drama at every turn. It seems ram-skate has declared that he won't post again on Cliff Richards blog over a furore of loose lips. What is Tricky Dicky going to do now??? Especially now he's admited to being the most infamous president of all time, surely he needs his shady associates to help gather info on any possible 'opponents' to avoid any challenges, or worse still..... impeachment!<br /><br />Will this in future years become known as 'Eastcliffgate'? Will ram-skate become know as 'deep-scroat'? Guess we'll just have to wait for the next thrilling installment!
