It's the first Saturday. Infact, the first day of a new blog. I'm sure there are 1million and 1 other blogs like it, but I want my own. I think that's the whole point. To get lost in the sea of people shouting.<br /><br />I've been reading blogs for a good while now. I have some favorites. <a href="http://eastcliffrichard.blogspot.com">EastcliffRichard</a>, <a href="http://artsandelbows.blogspot.com">Arts and Elbows</a>, that sort of thing. I already have my own website called <a href="http://oonagi.co.uk">oonagi</a> thats been going for about six years. That's kinda blogish, but is tailored for a specific topic; rock in Thanet. So I can't really say whatever I want about whatever I want there.<br /><br />I'm not really a diary kinda person, but I do have stuff I want to write. So here is where it will be. If a topic is relevant, I will post it elsewhere too, but this is really for me at the moment. :)
