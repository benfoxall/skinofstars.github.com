Is there a point to blogging? I think there is perhaps even a beauty to it. It is an opportunity to express yourself with added bonus that people may actually hear your words. It makes such a difference to ranting to your walls, which instantly absorb and forget. The words hang in the air for others to view for <a href="http://eastcliffrichard.blogspot.com/2006_01_01_eastcliffrichard_archive.html">months</a>, or even <a href="http://birchington.blogspot.com/2003_10_01_birchington_archive.html">years</a> down the line. Though you can be sure that you are only remember you by the last thing you utter. I remember posting a youtube of myself doing diablo work on here and one of the comments I recieved was the statment 'not sure if your into girls or boys' (I paraphrase), yet only a couple of posts earlier I was talking about my g/f  (girlfriend in J17 talk). Its like the classic, people replying to forum threads with the words 'I couldn't be bothered to read the whole thing, so I just read the last post'.<br /><br />None the less, blogging is a very personal and in its own way very satisfying thing. You say what you want to get of your chest and damn the rest. I type because it makes me happy, not because it make you happy.
