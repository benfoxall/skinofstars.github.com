Hey all, just a quick one today. I just had a job interview and I was asked the question "which design websites do I frequent"? I ummed and erred a little before mentioning Digg and Slashdot. Not very design focused I know (except maybe Digg's design section). I also said that I trawl the blogs for Ideas, which is true. I neglected to mention one of my favourite sites though, one which each and every one of you should have in your Feed Reader: <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/">A List Apart</a>. I love that site and I felt a little ashamed for forgetting it, so as penance I am reminding you all to check it out.
