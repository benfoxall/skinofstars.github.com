Cripes, I make one post yesterday on the anonymity of <a href="http://eastcliffrichard.blogspot.com">Eastcliff Richard</a> and all of a sudden I'm splashed across not just his blog, but I'm listed on the <a href="http://birchington.blogspot.com">Thanet Life</a> blog too! What happened??? Not even oonagi is listed there. <br /><br />So last night I recorded a new webcast for <a href="http://oonagi.co.uk">oonagi</a>. This time it's a duo with me and little jim. Mainly talk with one track from Candy Sniper. It was good fun to do one bouncing off someone else so I think I'll do more like that. After that we headed down to Deviate goth club at Rainy's, Ramsgate. A neat idea for a late night metal get together on a Tuesday. Shame it was a bit dead, and those that were there were a bit miserable. I cheered some guys up by teaching them to make little paper cranes (spurred on by a conversation about my new band '1000 Cranes'), but all in all everyone was a bit long faced. Funny, goth kids are normally upbeat, bizarre as that may sound.
