Oh, what a treat... and just in time for Christmas! I am very pleased to find that the BBC has finally indulged my fetish for organic software by releasing a flash streaming version of their <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer">iPlayer</a>.<br /><br />Though of course flash isn't homespun in itself, it is cross platform compatible and so both myself and all those  other 'nix and Mac users out there can watch the last seven days of BBC content without the need for any of that Windows tosh! Not a Vista in sight! I need never miss another episode of Cash In The Attic again. Hurrah!
