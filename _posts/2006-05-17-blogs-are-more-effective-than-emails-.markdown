I can see the ripples of each post sending waves across the internet. The last post gets el'oonagi listed on Thanet Life (though in the blog section, guess it does look more like a blog these days) and a post or so before looks like it's going to get us a free BBQ from Eastcliff Richard. So long as he doesn't assume another name and declare himself <a href="http://eastcliffrichard.blogspot.com/2006/05/caption-winner.html">winner of his own competition</a>!<br /><br />Anyhows, for any of you ale drinkers out there, there is a great one down the Churchills at the moment called 'Waggledance'. It has settled nicely and I highly recommend it.
