Well, first things first. We have a new/old blogger on the circuit. <a href="http://thanet-eye.blogspot.com/">Ram Skate Raider has stated his/her own blog</a> where we can expect a contemptuous view of Thanet and all around.<br /><br />Ok, with that out the way I'll give you all some bigger news. There is a Manston Parish Council public meeting being held this Thursday with with a heavy emphasis on the highway aspects of the new housing estate thats to be built at Westwood Cross. This new estate is going to seriously impact on Thanet. Probably one of the biggest impacts is going to be the increased load on the already clogged roads in the area, especially the carpark we call Haine Road. Attending the meeting will be a senior officer of East Kent Highways. Also attending will be Charles Hibberd, County Councillor and as an extra treat, probably Roger Gale amongst others. I also expect Ladyboy to avoid this like the plague as there will be constituants present and God forbid he'd be around them without a photo-op showing him in a good light.<br /><br />If you want to attend (there were around 70 people at the last), it will begin at 7pm at the Hoverspeed Club in Manston. This is your chance to come and say your thing and experience first hand what it's like to be flatly ignored by those who's wages you pay for out of your taxes.
