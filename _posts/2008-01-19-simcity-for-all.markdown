Those lovely guys at EA have open-sourced the SimCity code for use on OLPC, except the actual name SimCity, which we must now call Micropolis. I'm afraid to say that it's only available for Linux at the moment but I'm sure its only a matter of time till someone ports it to Windows.<br /><br />For the time being the .deb can be found here:<br />http://www.getdeb.net/app.php?name=Micropolis<br /><br />Or you could build it from source for your own nix system from here:<br />http://www.donhopkins.com/home/micropolis/
