I know it's popular to call webcasts podcasts nowadays, but I'm not tempted to jump on the bandwagon. For a start, I don't own an iPod and I never play them on iPods (I usually use songbird, a neat open source media player). I've also found that other people think you need an iPod to play them. So I'll tick with good old 'webcast'. When I get round to sorting out my syndication, I'll call them 'syndicated webcasts'. I know, I'm old fashioned, but what can you do.<br /><br />My latest one on <a href="http://oonagi.co.uk">oonagi</a> (webcast no.5) got picked up by the <a href="http://eastcliffrichard.blogspot.com">Cliff Richard</a> on his blog. Good of him to mention it, also good of him to point out that sound levels are a bit screwy. I've been having this problem quite a bit. In line with my open source addiction, I'm using <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.com">Audacity</a>. This is a very neat audio recorder along the lines of the proprietary <a href="http://www.sonymediasoftware.com/products/soundforgefamily.asp">SoundForge</a>. You would hope that by webcast5 I would have sorted this out. Still I'll plug away. The main problem I've been having with it is amplifying the talking parts without it clipping. I've tried using the compressor, the clip remover, the peak smoother and every other plugin with 'er' on the end. Finally I resorted to going through each bit with the pencil tool and shifting each little wave manually. That wasn't fun, there must be another way. I'll play with it some more and hopefully figure it out.<br /><br />Me and Jim had lots of fun doing the last one and we're already talking about the next. Jim want to interview Duncan, our local celebrity trumpeter (who is mentioned on the cast). My main aim is just to play and talk about local bands. A nice dream for the future is to do videos of the bands live and to host them.
