With the wave of  new bloggers, welcome all, I've noticed that we are getting some serious skin/theme repetition. So I've made a little effort and got myself a new one to which I made some minor mods. Hope it isn't too difficult for anyone to look at or read from.<br /><br />Elsewhere on the circuit, seems someone has had the neat idea of  listing all the local blogs in one independent spot. So if you haven't already, get yourself over to <a href="http://thanetbloglist.blogspot.com">Thanet Blog List</a> and see if there are any you have missed.<br /><br />BTW, in case you wondered, we failed miserably at the quiz on every round except Harry Potter. Though it did seem that everyone there has read the books except me, so we weren't the exception.
