Found a page with some neat GIMP tricks for photo manipulation.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.linuxfocus.org/English/September2003/article311.shtml">Linux Focus, GIMP Manipulation</a>.<br /><br />Don't be worried by the Linux Focus part, it's just where the article was written and is just as relevant for Windows versions.
